Time to take out the trash.
Gross! What's that smell? Looks like it's time to take out the trash.
Look at the time. It's trash thirty.
The trash isn't going to take out itself.
Help! Help! I'm being oppressed by the smell of this garbage!
Looks like it's time to take out the trash, Batman!
Rubbish! There's rubbish everywhere!
I've had soccer moms come up and tell me they can relate when I say that I want to throw my baby in the trash. A Quote from Louis CK
